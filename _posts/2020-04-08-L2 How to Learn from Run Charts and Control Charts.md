## Common Cause vs. Special Cause Variation

to get better results and understand better from our charts, we need to separate from common and special causes of variance.

|Common Cause                   |Special Cause                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Inherent to the system or process|not inherent to the process|
|from regular causes            |from irregular causes        |
|affects on all the outcomes of a process|affects on some but not all|
|Results in a stable process that is predictable|Results in a un-stable process that is not predictable|
|random variation|non-random variation|

This is how common and special causes looks like in a chart:

## Counting Runs on a Run Chart
A run is one or more consecutive points that all lie on the same side of the median. To count runs, we draw circle around each run and count the circles. This example should explain how to cound runs:
In this example, we have 13 runs. Each green circle is one run. If point is ont he baseline, it does not count as part of the run.
