## Common Cause vs. Special Cause Variation

to get better results and understand better from our charts, we need to separate from common and special causes of variance.

|Common Cause                   |Special Cause                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Inherent to the system or process|not inherent to the process|
|from regular causes            |from irregular causes        |
|affects on all the outcomes of a process|affects on some but not all|
|Results in a stable process that is predictable|Results in a un-stable process that is not predictable|
|random variation|non-random variation|
